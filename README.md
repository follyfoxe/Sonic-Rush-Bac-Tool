# Sonic Rush BAC Tool
A tool for converting sonic rush .bac files to pngs.

# Usage
Go head over to the [new wiki!](https://github.com/chor64/Sonic-Rush-Bac-Tool/wiki)

# Compatability
I've tested it with some Sonic Rush's bac files and it seems to work fine.<br>
It seems that it might be also be compatible with Sonic Colors as well.<br>
I haven't tested it with Sonic Rush Adventure since i don't own the game.<br>

# About the new version
This is a new version made from scratch, it features a brand new winforms-based user interface, a lot of code changes, and a lot more stability overall.<br>
It no longer uses Tinke's image library as i implemented the tile part myself this time.

Again, highly based on [NotKit's python BAC script.](https://github.com/NotKit/sonic-rush-tools/blob/master/bac.py)
